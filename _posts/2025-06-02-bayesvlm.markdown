While Vision-Language models have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, the lack of uncertainty estimation makes them unreliable in high-stakes applications. We propose a post-hoc uncertainty quantification method based on Laplace approximation, which provides useful predictive uncertainties and better calibration.
