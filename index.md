## About Me

Hi, welcome.

I'm a first-year PhD student at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), supervised by [Prof Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/). Prior to it, I got my MSc in Machine Learning from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), and BSc in Physics from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/cn/index.htm). 

I'm generally interested in probabilistic machine learning, in particular Gaussian process, generative model and Bayesian deep learning. I am also interested in meta learning.
